# fract-ol

Explore the wonderfull world of fractals!

### Building 

`make bonus`


### Execution

`./fract-ol <FRACTAL_TYPE>`

#### Available types
  - Julia
  - Mandelbrot
  - Tricorn


### Controls

`mouse scroll` : zoom in and out the fractal (endlessly)

`arrow keys` : move the fractal

`A` `S` : change color range


## The Project

In this project you will have to use minilibX (maybe for the first time) in order to create a small fractal exploration program.


### Getting started with MLX

Official linux repo : https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux

As the documentation for it is sort of light, the only way to really know the minilibX is to play around with it. This example is verry usefull as it cover the very basics : https://github.com/keuhdall/images_example

Then by scraping these docs you should begin to get it :

### Fractals

The Wikipedia pages contains everything you need to know to achieve the mandatory part :
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

With that said, good luck <3

PS: If you need to add anything, just PR ;)
